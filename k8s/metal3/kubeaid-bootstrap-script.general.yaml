    # This SSH config will be used by default, for all the bare-metal hosts.
    #
    # FYI, regarding KubeOne :
    #
    #   (1) KubeOne works only when SSHed as the root user, so we have removed the ssh.user
    #       configuration option.
    #
    #   (2) KubeOne doesn't read your local SSH configuration (present in ~/.ssh/config).
    #
    # If you don't provide details about an SSH private key, then the SSH auth socket will be used
    # to authenticate to your Linux based bare-metal servers.
    # So, whenever Kubermatic KubeOne tries to authenticate to your bare-metal Linux servers,
    # KubeAid Bootstrap Script will prompt you to touch the YubiKey.
